  A strange image has been discovered, but something isn’t quite right…  
  The image appears corrupted and won’t open properly.  
  Even if you recover it, there’s more than meets the eye.

  **Your Goal:**
  - Recover the corrupted image if necessary.
  - Extract all hidden flag pieces using forensic analysis.
  - Combine them to reconstruct the full flag.
  - Submit the final flag in the format: **`shellmateCTF{...}`**.

  **Hints:**
  - Some things leave traces… even in metadata.
  - A file header is more important than you think.
  - Look closely at the image and its colors!
  - There may be something extra hidden inside.
