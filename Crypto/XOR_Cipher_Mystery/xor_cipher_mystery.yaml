  The flag has been XOR-encrypted using a **3-character repeating key**. Can you recover the original flag?

  **Your Goal:**
  - Decrypt the XOR-encrypted message in `encrypted.txt`.
  - Recover the original flag.

  **Hints:**
  - The encryption used **XOR with a repeating key**.
  - The key is **three characters long**.
  - The flag format is **`shellmateCTF{...}`**.
